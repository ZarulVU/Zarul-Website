          <li>Clementines</li>
          <li>3 cups of sugar</li>
          <li>450g of cake flour</li>
          <li>1 ½ tsp salt</li>
          <li>¾ tsp of baking powder</li>

          <li>487.5g of sugar</li>
          <li>6 large eggs</li>
          <li>3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>¾ cup clementine juice</li>
          <li>Zest of 4 clementines</li>
          <li>1 ¼ cup buttermilk</li>
          <li>Nonstick spray</li>
          <li>Parchment paper</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Clementine Glaze</p>
      <ul>
          <li>150g sifted powdered sugar</li>
          <li>30-45 ml of clementine juice</li>
          <li>Zest of 1 clementine</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <div class="column">
      <ol type="1">
          <li>Start by slicing 3 clementines for candying. Make sure you slice them very thin.</li>
          <li>Poach the clementines in boiling water for 1 minute, and then shock them by transferring them to a bowl of ice water.</li>
          <li>Combine 3 cups of sugar and 1 ½ cups of water in a large saucepan. Add a little squeeze of clementine juice and bring to a sweet gentle simmer. Add clementines in a single layer and simmer for 90 minutes, flipping every 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Once soft and translucent, cool on a wire rack and pour clementine syrup into a measuring cup for later. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Weigh out 450g of cake flour to which you’re going to add 1 ½ tsp of salt, ¾ tsp of baking powder, and ¾ tsp of baking soda. Whisk to combine.</li>
          <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix 1 ½ cups of butter until creamy</li>
          <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add 487.5g of sugar and mix that as well.</li>
          <li>Scrape down the sides again, and add 6 large eggs and 3 tsp of vanilla extract. Mix again.</li>
          <li>Add ¾ cup of clementine juice and the zest of 4 clementines and mix to combine.</li>
          <li>Finally add the dry ingredients and 1 ¼ cups of buttermilk and mix just enough to combine.</li>
          <li>Coat a cake pan with nonstick spray and parchment paper. Add the cake batter and cook at 350°F for 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Use a cake tester or a knife to make sure the cake is completely done.</li>
          <li>Generously brush down the cake with clementine syrup.</li>
          <li>Pour glaze over the top and add candied clementines.</li>
          <li>Slice yourself a piece and enjoy.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Clementine Glaze</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Combine 150g of sifted powdered sugar, 30-45 ml of clementine juice, and the zest of one clementine. Whisk to combine. (You can use milk instead of juice to look more accurate to the movie, but the juice is better)</li></ol>

  <div class="column">
      <ol type="1">
          <li>Start by combining 1 ½ cups of buttermilk with ½ a cup of boiling milk to which we are going to add 4 tsp of dry yeast and 2 ½ Tbsp of sugar. Stir to combine and set aside for 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>In a stand mixer bowl, combine 22 ounces of bread flour with ½ tsp of baking soda and ½ a tsp of kosher salt. Mix to combine before adding our milk and yeast mixture. Make sure your dough hook is attached and mix for about 3-4 minutes. You want the dough to be sticky.</li>
          <li>Transfer dough to a separate bowl. Cover and let sit for 1 hour.</li>
          <li>Liberally flour your work surface and turn out your dough onto the flour. Coat the dough with a nice thick layer of flour before rolling out to about ¼ inch thick. Trim off the edges to make a nice big rectangle and then cut into smaller rectangles.</li>
          <li>Preheat your oil to 370°F and then add 3-5 pieces of dough to the oil. Be sure to baste the skyward facing side of the beignets constantly for about 2 minutes before flipping and letting cook for about 30 more seconds.</li>
          <li>Remove from oil and place on a plate that is lined with paper towels.</li>
          <li>Dust them down with liberally with powdered sugar. Serve and enjoy!</li>
          <li>If you want to make them like the beignets from The Princess and the Frog, add honey to them before you add your powdered sugar!</li>

        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
            <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more room temperature for ramekins</li>
            <li>¼ cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar; plus more for ramekins and sprinkling</li>
            <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (70% cacao), coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brewed coffee</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 large egg whites, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup best-quality vanilla ice cream, melted (such as Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Bean)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Special Equipment</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Four 6–7-ounce ramekins</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°. Brush insides and rims of ramekins with butter, using straight upward strokes all the way around sides.</li> 
            <li>Sprinkle with sugar and tap out excess (the upward strokes and sugar will give batter something to cling to as it rise up above tops of ramekins); set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat chocolate, coffee, and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large heatproof bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture. It will look grainy; whisk in 2 tsp. water and the mixture will become smooth and glossy again.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in the very clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until frothy, about 30 seconds (you can also use a hand-held beater, or do this by hand with a balloon whisk).</li>
            <li>Add salt, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until soft, creamy peaks form, about 2 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Slowly sprinkle in remaining ¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. sugar and continue to beat until firm, shiny, glossy peaks form (if they look dry or clumpy, you’ve gone too far;<a href="http://video.bonappetit.com/watch/how-to-whip-egg-whites-for-every-use"> check out this video before you start).</a></li>
            <li>Using a large spatula, fold one-third of egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten.</li>
            <li>Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions, using large, deliberate strokes all the way to the bottom of the mixture to incorporate whites without deflating, until barely any streaks remain.</li> 
            <li>Spoon into prepared ramekins, mounding batter over rim.</li> 
            <li>Using a large offset spatula, bench scraper, or back of a chef’s knife, scrape across tops of ramekins to make batter level, which will encourage a nice flat top on the finished soufflés.</li>
            <li>Discard excess batter, or scrape into another dish and bake separately. </li>
            <li>Tap ramekins lightly on counter to help settle batter. Sprinkle surface of batter with sugar, then gently run your thumb inside rim of ramekin just around lip to create a small circular indentation (this will help the soufflés rise with straight sides; be careful not to rub off butter coating underneath).</li>
            <li>Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer immediately to oven. Reduce temperature to 400° and bake soufflés until they have risen and wobble slightly when jostled, 12–15 minutes. Immediately break a spoon into centers and pour some melted ice cream into each one.</li>

                <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has rested, take one portion and start by poking the dough with your fingertips. Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin crust. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking!</li>
                <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an inverted baking sheet and place your stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your preference.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until the crust and cheese looks golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add any garnish of your preference and enjoy!</li>

    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This website is a quick and easy access to a compilation of recipes that I find interesting online. Most of the recipes are desserts, with some italian food as well. Originally, there was supposed to be only one button which shows a random recipe. Unfortunately, I have a hard time trying to make it work so I scrapped that and just made it so all the recipes are available.</p>
    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>Absolutely none of these recipes are made by me. They are all made by different people throughout the internet. Links to the original websites that the recipes come from are accessible via the button that says 'Original' found below the picture/video</p>
